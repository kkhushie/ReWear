# 👚 ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Every year, wearable clothing is thrown away due to lack of access to platforms that promote sustainable fashion. ReWear aims to reduce textile waste by enabling people to donate or exchange clothing easily — either via direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The platform encourages users to reuse garments rather than discard them.
